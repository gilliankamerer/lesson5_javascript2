### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Arrays are just like a title next to spaced out notes: they keep things looking clean and keep data in order for later (easy) review. 
2. When you add an "if" statement, it specifies what to do when data entered meets a certain condition.
3. "Break" statements allow you to end the previous looping statement such as "while" or "do/while".
